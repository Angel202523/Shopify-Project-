# Shopify-Project

Objective: Build a fully functional Shopify storefront for a fictional business with specific
requirements. This test evaluates your expertise in Shopify Liquid, API integration, front-end
customization, and creative problem-solving.
Scenario:
You are tasked with creating an online store for a fictional brand called "Greenline
Electronics", which specializes in selling eco-friendly gadgets.

Task Breakdown:
1. Store Setup and Theme Customization (Front-End Development)
● Use the Shopify developer tools to set up a basic Shopify store.
● Customize a free Shopify theme (e.g., Dawn) to reflect the brand’s eco-friendly
aesthetic.
○ Modify the color scheme and typography to align with eco-friendly values.
○ Add a custom header and footer.
○ Design a product landing page with sections for:
■ Product image carousel.
■ Features and benefits.
■ Customer reviews (use dummy content).
■ FAQ section (use dummy content).
=>Done

5. Dynamic Cart and Checkout Experience
● Enhance the cart functionality by adding the following:
○ A "Free Shipping" progress bar that updates dynamically based on the cart
total.
○ A discount field where customers can apply coupon codes.
=>Done
Notes
1. I have customized shipping bar with code and disocunts in shopify
2. Even i have added disocounts on particular task


7. API Integration
● Integrate a third-party API into the store to fetch real-time exchange rates and
display product prices in two currencies (USD and EUR). Use a free API like
ExchangeRate-API.
==>I have tried implementing these by making snippets called currency.liquid and rendering in header.liquid.

● Add a currency switcher dropdown in the header to toggle between the currencies.
=>Done with shopify markets


5. Custom Functionality: Newsletter Subscription
● Add a custom newsletter subscription form in the footer.
○ When a user submits their email, store it in a dummy database or a JSON file.
